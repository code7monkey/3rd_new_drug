ChemBERTa inference configuration

This file specifies the inputs required for ``inference.py``.  The
``manifest_path`` should point to the ``manifest.json`` produced
during training.  The test data CSV must contain a column called
``Smiles`` and optionally an ``ID`` column.  Predictions will be
averaged across all folds listed in the manifest and written to the
file named in ``submission_name``.

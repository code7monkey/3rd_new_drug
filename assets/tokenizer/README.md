This directory is intended to hold the tokenizer files associated
with your ChemBERTa model.  The HuggingFace ``AutoTokenizer`` will
look for files such as ``tokenizer.json``, ``tokenizer_config.json``
and ``vocab.txt`` in this location if you load from a local path.

When committing to Git, consider using Git LFS for these files as
they can be large.
